🌟 About Me
I’m Silap, a Senior Software Engineer and Founder with 6+ years of experience building scalable, user-centric systems that solve real-world problems. My work sits at the intersection of infrastructure reliability, data intelligence, and human-centered design — because technology should empower people, not overwhelm them.

🚀 What I’ve Built
I architected and launched a high-performance video streaming platform used by thousands — engineered for low latency, adaptive bitrate streaming, and seamless playback across devices. From ingest to delivery, every layer was built with resilience and observability in mind.

I also developed a modular CMS system now trusted by 20+ companies worldwide. It powers content workflows for media, education, and enterprise clients — combining flexibility, security, and an intuitive editor experience. No two clients use it the same way, and that’s by design.

💡 Why I Founded Eunoia
While building complex systems, I noticed a growing crisis: digital tools are making us more distracted, not more focused. Notifications, infinite scroll, dopamine-driven UIs — they hijack attention, especially for people with ADHD and neurodivergent minds.

That’s why I created Eunoia (from the Greek εὔνοια — “beautiful thinking”):

A digital sanctuary designed to restore deep focus, calm, and intentional living. 

Unlike mainstream apps that optimize for screen time, Eunoia is anti-ADHD-by-design — not in the sense of “fixing” neurodiversity, but by removing the friction that modern apps create.

🧘‍♂️ Zero distractions: No pop-ups, no feeds, no urgency.
🕰️ Time-aware interfaces: Gentle nudges, not alarms.
🌱 Focus-first UX: Every interaction supports presence, not consumption.
🔒 Privacy by default: Your attention belongs to you — not advertisers.
Eunoia isn’t just an app. It’s a quiet rebellion against attention economy.

⚙️ My Tech Stack & Philosophy
I build with Go for backend services (concurrency, efficiency, reliability), Python for data pipelines and analytics, and TypeScript + React for expressive, accessible frontends. As an SRE at heart, I treat every system as a living organism — observable, automatable, and gracefully degradable.

But tools are secondary to purpose.

Great engineering serves human dignity — not engagement metrics. 

🌍 Let’s Connect
I’m always open to conversations about Web3 infrastructure, ethical product design, ADHD-inclusive tech, or collaborating on mission-driven projects.
