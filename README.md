## üí° Why I Founded Eunoia
While building complex systems, I saw a growing issue: digital tools are making us more distracted, not more focused.  
**Eunoia** (from Greek *Œµ·ΩîŒΩŒøŒπŒ±* ‚Äî ‚Äúbeautiful thinking‚Äù) is a digital sanctuary designed to restore focus, calm, and intentional living.

Eunoia Principles:
- üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Zero distractions** ‚Äî no pop-ups, no feeds, no urgency.  
- üï∞Ô∏è **Time-aware interfaces** ‚Äî gentle nudges, not alarms.  
- üå± **Focus-first UX** ‚Äî every interaction supports presence.  
- üîí **Privacy by default** ‚Äî your attention belongs to you.  

Eunoia isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúfixing‚Äù neurodiversity ‚Äî it‚Äôs about removing the friction that mainstream apps create.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Philosophy
- **Backend:** Go (concurrency, efficiency, reliability)  
- **Data:** Python (pipelines, analytics)  
- **Frontend:** TypeScript + React (accessible, expressive)  
- **Approach:** SRE mindset ‚Äî systems are observable, automatable, and gracefully degradable.  

> Great engineering serves human dignity, not engagement metrics.
